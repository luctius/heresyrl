reminder
rolling 1 on magic die causes will check or 1 insanity.

wfrp:
Move (TURN/movement)
Attack (TURN/attack)
main hand parry 1/TURN, unless main hand is used for attack.
off- hand parry 1/TURN, unless off hand is used for attack.
dodge 1/TURN, unless dodge is not trained.

BUGS:
cannot throw tools anymore.
vision is not a circle
could not wield a shortbow after dropping it? (low ammo?)
switching weapons sometimes sets weapon select to unarmed.
unarmed and offhand weapons do not offer a targetting window.
