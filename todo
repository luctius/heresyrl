Major Ideas:
Improve Vision and lighting code, add stealth gameplay.
Quack medicine, most of the times provides a benefit, and also something else.
Critical damage should be tracked seperatly, and only normal damage can be 
    healed through non magical means.
Dungeon generation with doors and better loops.
Add leader follow ai code, and improve ai in general.
Add more critical hits to have a full system again.
Use non-melee items in melee.
Provide TERM_COLOUR <-> colour msg attr translation.
Title Screen and Death screen.
[C]ombine as an inventory command OR [A]lternate Use.
Blood spatter and blood trail when a wounded monster moves.
Charms, minor items which take the charm slot and provide minor benefit
Episodic maps; large map, after the quest some downtime to heal 
    non-critical wounds, buy stuff and go to next mission.
Create dungeon objects (like barrels) and treat them as cover
Have campfires and monsters around them.
Foretell the players doom.
Overhaul replay code to add pause, rewind, slowdowns etc.
Magic system and winds of magic
Insanity system
Corruption system

Minor
Create a XX turn tick function for new monster spawns and mushroom generation etc.
Chests with locks
Oil and fire which spreads
Status effects add temporary talent
Markdown readme ingame?
Move spawn decisions to map
'? - something should be identified with enough DoS.'

Reminder
Rolling 1 on magic die causes will check or 1 insanity.

BUGS:
The four cardinal directions of the FOV are touched twice.
Encumbrance reports every turn or so.
Explosion touches twice? (FOV bug?)
Torches should be held when activated, and their fuel use is bugged.
Create general arrays for the item use_desc, which should also be used for tools, food and wearables and for improvised weapons.
Throwing weapons tohit calculations are off.
Archers do not shoot anymore? -- fixed?
Switching weapons sometimes sets weapon select to unarmed. -- fixed?
Unarmed and offhand weapons do not offer a targetting window.
Could not wield a shortbow after dropping it (low ammo?)?
Could not wield a knife?
Announce seen monsters (and only once or so)
Apply penalty for stealth on both attack and being attacked.

Combat:
Check if an archer is in melee combat by checking for enemies with melee weapons around him.
A melee attacker attacking someone not holding a melee weapon should get a bonus.
A melee attacker attacking someone in the light should get a bonus?
BS or WS should be used to counter evasion.
