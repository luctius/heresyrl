magic system and winds of magic
insanity system
corruption system



ideas:
Episodic maps; large map, after the quest some downtime to heal 
non-critical wounds, buy stuff and go to next mission.
charms, minor items which take the charm slot and provide minor benefit
quack medicine, most of the times provides a benefit, and also something else.

create dungeon objects (like barrels) and treat them as cover.
chests with locks
oil and fire which spreads
status effects add temporary talent
markdown readme ingame?
move spawn decisions to map

reminder
rolling 1 on magic die causes will check or 1 insanity.

wfrp:
Move (TURN/movement)
Attack (TURN/attack)

BUGS:
cannot throw tools anymore.
vision is not a circle
?could not wield a shortbow after dropping it? (low ammo?)
?could not wield a knife?
switching weapons sometimes sets weapon select to unarmed.
unarmed and offhand weapons do not offer a targetting window.
msg_win disapears after some fullscreen windows,
Throwing weapons tohit calculations are off.
Torches should be held when activated, and their fuel use is bugged.
