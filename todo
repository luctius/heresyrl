Major Ideas:
Episodic maps; large map, after the quest some downtime to heal 
   non-critical wounds, buy stuff and go to next mission.
Quack medicine, most of the times provides a benefit, and also something else.
Critical damage should be tracked seperatly, and only normal damage can be 
    healed through non magical means.
Add status effect symbols to charwin, show negative and positive modifications of characteristics
Add leader follow ai code, and improve ai in general.
Add more critical hits to have a full system again.
Use non-melee items in melee.
Dungeon generation with doors and better loops.
Provide TERM_COLOUR <-> colour msg attr translation.
Title Screen and Death screen. <-- New Title
[C]ombine as an inventory command OR [A]lternate Use.
Write a layer between the dungeon_map and the display map.,
    for hallucination effects etc.

Later:
Blood spatter and blood trail when a wounded monster moves.
Charms, minor items which take the charm slot and provide minor benefit
Create dungeon objects (like barrels) and treat them as cover
Have campfires and monsters around them.
Foretell the players doom.
Overhaul replay code to add pause, rewind, slowdowns etc.
Magic system and winds of magic
Insanity system
Corruption system
Improve Vision and lighting code, add stealth gameplay. -- More testing and balancing is required.

Minor
Create a XX turn tick function for new monster spawns and mushroom generation etc.
Chests with locks
Oil and fire which spreads
Status effects add temporary talent
Markdown readme ingame?
Move spawn decisions to map
Beastmen who charge ahead for 4 tiles or so and can't stop.
'? - something should be identified with enough DoS.'

Reminder
Rolling 1 on magic die causes will check or 1 insanity.
