HeresyRL
========

Introduction
------------

HeresyRL is a [roguelike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike) in the 
vain of rogue, nethack, angband and crawl. It is based on the Warhammer 
Roleplay version 2 ruleset.

Right now it is in Alpha status, but eventually it will be an episodic game. 
You will play a map (or maybe even a quest). At the end you will have the 
oppertunity to heal, buy/sell items, and to train.


Compiling
---------

Dependencies:
* A *nix (linux or mac for example)
* libncurses5-dev
* lua 5.x
* Autotools
* A C compiler (gcc or clang)

For a debian based Distribution (Debian, Ubuntu, Mint ...):
* 'sudo apt-get install autoconf automake build-essential autotools-dev liblua5.1-0-dev libncurses5-dev'
* 'autoreconf -fim && ./configure'
* 'make'
* './heresyrl'


For OSX the following should work:
* 'brew install lua homebrew/dupes/ncurses ; brew doctor ; brew link ncurses --force'
* 'autoreconf -fim &&  LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/ncurses/lib" CPPFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/ncurses/include" ./configure'
* 'make'
* './heresyrl'
