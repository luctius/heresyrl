Introduction
------------

HeresyRL is a [roguelike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike) in the 
vain of rogue, nethack, angband and crawl. It is based on the Warhammer 
Roleplay version 2 ruleset.

Right now it is in Alpha status, but eventually it will be an episodic game. 
You will play a map (or maybe even a quest). At the end you will have the 
oppertunity to heal, buy/sell items, and to train.
