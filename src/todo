ideas:

accept input from savegame (replay) -- done => add pauze, play, step etc
Make the game sound based (actions cost sound, enemies go to the biggest sound source, hounds bark, etc)
sound based detection and npc communication
Vendor machines and Medical machines.
autoexplore in direction
steroids and other chems. <- in condition system
warp artifacts
warp based grenades
create dungeon objects (like barrels) and treat them as cover.

bugs:
fght descriptors per weapon (fire,slash,spit,spray,chop ... )
