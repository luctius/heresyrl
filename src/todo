item generation         -- initial system done
basic career and homeworld system

character screen        -- initial screen done
basic chargen           -- initial screen done
better ingame message system -- done

ideas:

accept input from savegame (replay) -- done add pauze, play, step etc
Make the game sound based (actions cost sound, enemies go to the biggest sound source, hounds bark, etc)
sound based detection and npc communication
Vendor machines and Medical machines.
autoexplore in direction
steroids and other chems.
warp artifacts
warp based grenades

bugs:
fght descriptors per weapon (fire,slash,spit,spray,chop ... )
