basic fighting system   -- throwing, effects and criticals remain
monster generation      -- initial system done
item generation         -- initial system done
status effect system    -- initial system done
character screen        -- initial screen done
basic chargen           -- initial screen done
title screen            -- nothing done yet
better ingame message system -- todo, write to save file...
ai                      -- initial system done
basic career and homeworld system
use and remove fatique


ideas:

accept input from savegame (replay) -- done add pauze, play, step etc
Make the game sound based (actions cost sound, enemies go to the biggest sound source, hounds bark, etc)
sound based detection and npc communication
Vendor machines and Medical machines.
autoexplore in direction
steroids and other chems. <- in condition system
warp artifacts
warp based grenades
create dungeon objects (like barrels) and treat them as cover.

bugs:
fght descriptors per weapon (fire,slash,spit,spray,chop ... )
