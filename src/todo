ideas:

accept input from savegame (replay)
Make the game sound based (actions cost sound, enemies go to the biggest sound source, hounds bark, etc)
Vendor machines and Medical machines.
autoexplore in direction
sound based detection and npc communication
steroids and other chems.
warp artifacts
warp based grenades

bugs:
fght descriptors per weapon (fire,slash,spit,spray,chop ... )
